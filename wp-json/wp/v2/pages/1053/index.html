However, as determined as I might have been, I could not put into practice all that I really wanted in that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For you to have an idea, those ambitions, not always necessary, were so big that they interfered in my personal life, to the point that I could not bear the weight of them and it took me a long time to advance the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I see it, what I really lacked was planning, which could avoid all these issues. A very striking example is the plot of the game, which was initially based on the corruption scheme of the &#8220;Mensal\u00e3o&#8221; of the mid-2000s, in the Government of the PT, which over the years have been kinda forgotten, and I had to replace the plot by Globo, predicted in BraSonic 1 cliffhanger, and later a villain proper for the game. In this the sequel of game levels was also affected, where I had to create new, delete old, recycle and redo existing, and in Game Maker software until version 8.1 was not a very practical task and that took a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other important things like Special Stages, Boss battles, and bug fixes have been left out. If I had planned the project in a closed way, I would not have wasted so much time with rework, and the game would have come out in a much shorter time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I had great learning in the midst of all these misadventures, regardless of the level of my ambition with the project. I understood the complexity of a project of a long game that demanded many tests, trial and error, work and rework; the need for a more timeless plot for long projects, which I tried to make happen in the post-2010 versions. Of course, more technical learnings such as digital art, animation, game development, and level design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was upset that I had not been able to finish BraSonic 2, also because of the &#8220;coaxing&#8221;, lack of communication and disappearance, but I do not regret having invested time in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I apologize for missing out on this game, for you who have been waiting for you all these years, and I hope all of these reports can make a positive contribution to your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bruno C.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Among all those years, as the BrazSonic 2 project evolved, I became more and more ambitious time by time.
