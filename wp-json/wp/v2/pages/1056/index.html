It uses to happen on the start screen and &#8220;new game&#8221; start.<br><br><strong>&#8220;Background does not exists&#8221;: <\/strong><br>Close the game and try running again.<br><br><strong>Level music does not play: <\/strong><br>This is a bug that still persists on some computers, happened even with my own PC, I&#8217;m still looking for the solution to this. When the stage music does not play, and you pick up some &#8220;power-up&#8221; of invincibility or speed, you can play, in infinite loop, their music or the sound of the jump.<br><br><strong>Backgrounds are not displaying:<\/strong> <br>For some reason, that I have not discovered yet, if the &#8220;Background does not exists&#8221; error does not appear the game may at some point lose the link with the external files of the phase sceneries and thus not load the sceneries parts from the front of the level (ground, loopings, ramps, etc.). This may stop appearing as soon as you change level.<br><br><strong>Foregrounds are not displaying:<\/strong><br>For the same reason above, perhaps due to some software bug where the game was developed, the scenario of the front (floor, ramps, etc.), if it does not present an error message, it can load with its disfigured pieces with strange colors. This does not affect the course of the phase, only the aesthetics.<br><br><strong>General crashing:<\/strong> <br>Tends to happen after a time of play, the game freezes and the scenery may be all disfigured. This tends to happen more often with PeloTails and Baianuckles. In that case, I recommend closing the game and trying to reopen the game. If it persists, I recommend trying on another machine.<br><br><strong>The Brazil map is not being displayed on the level select screen, just the water:<\/strong> <br>Try pressing &#8220;S&#8221; to go back and choose the same character to proceed to the map to appear again. This is a common bug in this version, which does not affect the game itself, just the aesthetics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stuff that had been left behind..<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boss Battles<\/strong><br>I had to remove them because of bugs, and also why the development of this version was too focused on the levels design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All the Versions Is it Game Pad\/Joystick playable?This feature was even put into practice during development, but after a while removed due to bugs.
