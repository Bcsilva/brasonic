The Gravatar privacy policy is available here: https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/. After your comment has been approved, your profile picture is publicly visible next to your comment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Media<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you send images to the site, avoid sending those that contain embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors can download these images from the site and extract their location data from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Contact Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cookies<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By leaving a comment on the site, you may choose to save your name, email and website in cookies. This is for your comfort, so you do not have to fill in your data again when you make another comment. These cookies last for one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an account and access this site, a temporary cookie will be created to determine if your browser accepts cookies. It does not contain any personal information and will be discarded when you close your browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you access your account on the site, we also create multiple cookies to save your account data and your display choices. Login cookies are held for two days and screen options cookies for one year. If you select &#8220;Remember me&#8221;, your access will be retained for two weeks. If you disconnect from your account, your login cookies will be removed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved to your browser. This cookie does not include any personal data and simply indicates the post ID for the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Embedded media from other sites<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content such as videos, pictures, articles, etc. Embedded content from other sites behaves exactly the same as if the visitor were visiting the other site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sites may collect data about you, use cookies, incorporate additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with this embedded content, including your interaction with embedded content if you have an account and are connected to the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How long do we keep your data?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are preserved indefinitely. We do this so that you can automatically recognize and approve any subsequent comments rather than retaining them for moderation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users who register with our site (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can view, edit or delete your personal information at any time (only you can not change your username). Site administrators can also view and edit this information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are your rights to your data?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an account with this site or if you have left comments, you may request an exported file of the personal information we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we remove any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are required to maintain for administrative, legal or security purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Para onde enviamos seus dados<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments from visitors can be marked by an automatic spam detection service.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who are we O endere\u00e7o do nosso site \u00e9: http:\/\/brasonic.com\/.
